# crisalvarez.github.io

This repository contains the source for my personal website at [https://crisalvarez.github.io](https://crisalvarez.github.io).

The site is built with GitHub Pages and Jekyll and uses custom CSS for a simple, retro-inspired layout.

## Contents

- `index.md` – main homepage content.
- `_config.yml` – site configuration (theme, title, settings).
- `assets/css/style.scss` – custom styles for fonts, layout, and spacing.
