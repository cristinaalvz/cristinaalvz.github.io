This repository contains the source for my personal website at [https://cribby.github.io](https://cribby.github.io).[web:41][web:115]

The site is built with GitHub Pages and Jekyll and uses custom CSS for a simple, retro-inspired layout.[web:112][web:117]

## Contents

- `index.md` – main homepage content.
- `_config.yml` – site configuration (theme, title, settings).
- `assets/css/style.scss` – custom styles for fonts, layout, and spacing.[web:113][web:115]
